The best method would be to use a mix of both, zipping files on runtime for a course with less(a threshold can be set) number of users 
registered and storing zip files for large courses. This way, hard disk space and computation power are optimized. This however, requires 
a database table with entries of all courses and their number of registered users. For a popular course, whenever a user uploads a file, 
the old zip file is discarded and a new file is saved. This reduces the number of times the zip process is used because the probability of
a user uploading is less than that of a user downloading. In the case of the course having fewer registrations, the zip can be generated at
runtime.
